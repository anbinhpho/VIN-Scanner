# VIN-Scanner

## Why I Built This

Honestly, I was sitting in my bed thinking of what I could do. All my past projects weren't that interesting to me. I wanted to do a project that could correlate with my car hobby. There's been a rise in car theft and I've seen vigilantes, such as Mark McCann, who has become prominent in car theft recovery by documenting and creating content around exposing car thieves.
