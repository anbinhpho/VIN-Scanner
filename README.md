# VIN-Scanner

## Why I Built This

Honestly, I was sitting in my bed thinking of what I could do. All my past projects weren't that interesting to me. I wanted something that connected to my car hobby—and actually mattered. With car theft on the rise, I've been following people like Mark McCann who expose cloned and stolen vehicles. That got me thinking: what if I could build a tool that reads VINs from photos? This project is my way of learning the full machine learning pipeline—from data collection to model training to deployment—while building something that could actually help spot stolen cars.

## Features

- Batch processes multiple images from a folder
- Extracts text using PaddleOCR
- Identifies and validates 17-character VINs
- Works best with landscape-oriented images

## Roadmap

- [ ] Object detection with PaddleDetection to automatically locate VIN regions
- [ ] Improved handling of portrait-oriented images
- [ ] License plate reading capabilities
- [ ] Web application interface
- [ ] Vehicle verification system for detecting cloned vehicles
